# Getting Started

If you haven't installed the SDK yet, please [head over to the QuickStart guide]({{ page.quickstart }}#parse_data/mobile/ios/native/new) to get our SDK up and running in Xcode. Note that we support iOS 7.0 and higher. You can also check out our [iOS and macOS API Reference](/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX/api) for more detailed information about our SDK.
